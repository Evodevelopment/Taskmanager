**Project Idea: Task Tracker**

**Description:** Create a simple task tracker application that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks. You'll use Python for the backend logic, SQL for data storage, GitHub for version control, and VSCode as your code editor.

**Steps to Complete the Project:**

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
   - Install Python: If you haven't already, install Python on your computer.
   - Install a SQL Database: You can use SQLite, which is a lightweight and easy-to-set-up database that doesn't require a separate server installation.

2. **Create a New GitHub Repository:**
   - Create a new GitHub repository for your project. This will be your version control system.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   - In your project directory, create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies using `virtualenv` or `venv`. Activate it.

4. **Create a Database:**
   - Write a Python script to create a SQLite database that will store tasks. You can use the `sqlite3` library for this purpose. Define a table to store tasks.

5. **Build the Application:**
   - Write Python code for the following functionalities:
     - Add a new task to the database.
     - View all tasks in the database.
     - Delete a task from the database.

6. **Create a Simple Command Line Interface (CLI):**
   - Build a basic CLI interface that allows the user to interact with your task tracker application. Use libraries like `argparse` or `click` for command-line parsing.

7. **Test Your Application:**
   - Test your application to ensure it works as expected. Add some tasks, view them, and delete them.

8. **Commit to GitHub:**
   - Add your project files to the Git repository, commit your changes, and push them to GitHub. This will help you learn version control.

9. **Documentation:**
   - Write a simple README.md file explaining how to set up and use your application.

10. **Optional Enhancements:**
    - If you finish the basic project quickly and want to expand it, you can consider adding features like task priorities, due dates, or categories.
    - You can also build a simple web interface for your task tracker using a Python web framework like Flask or Django for a more full-stack experience.

Throughout this project, you'll gain experience with Python, SQL, GitHub, and VSCode. Plus, you'll have a functional task tracker application to use and show in your portfolio. Remember that programming is all about practice, so don't be discouraged if you encounter challenges along the way. Troubleshooting and problem-solving are valuable skills in software development. Good luck with your project!
